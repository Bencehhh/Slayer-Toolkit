MFD ERP GROUP LINKER

How to use:

Hello!
Thank you for downloading my ERP GROUP LINK APPENDER.

This tool works with any links.
Here is the steps how you can use it:

1. Open the HTML file
2. Click the Add Link Button
3. Paste your link in the textbox where the text says 'Paste your link here...'
4. If you want to add more links, just click the 'Add Link Button' as many times as you want.
5. You can add infinite link entries. This works with all kinds of links, not just Roblox group links. This works outside Roblox too!
6. You can add ERP accounts, ERP groups, ERP servers, ERP games and many more!
7. Before downloading make sure to click the Update Link Database button, so you can see all your entries printed out in a big textbox.
8. When you are done, click the Download Database button. You will get all your links in a single .txt file that you can send in the server for processing. 
Note: If there are no links in your pastes, after you clicked the Add Link button, you won't get a txt file uppon clicking the download button!
